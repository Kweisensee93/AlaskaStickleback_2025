For a better understanding of the topic several papers that are of interest are noted here.

Introduction to Parliament2 and MetaSV
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13059-021-02558-x
--> Those are 2 ways of using several tools for finding SVs

Parliament2 - A tool that bundles several software for finding SV
It bundles Breakdancer, CNVnator, Crest, Delly, Lumpy, Manta, and Pindel via SURVIVOR and validates via SVTyper
It parallelizes the tools used to save runtime. Gives similar (slightly better) results to MetaSV

MetaSV - last update 9 years ago:
https://github.com/bioinform/metasv?tab=readme-ov-file

Tools being used:
Manta, DELLY, LUMPY, BreakDancer, GRIDSS, CNVnator, SvABA, Pindel
For comparing tools: SURVIVOR (is part of Parliament2 ?) or MetaSV, SMOOVE, SpeedSeq SV, GATK-SV
From Illumina: svimmer ?

comparison of many tools (2024):

--> seems like +/- Manta is among the best tools

comparison of meta-callers:

Check how good your pipeline is --> Note: It is human data, hence not that applicable for fish data
