For Manta set up we follow the GitHub README:
https://github.com/Illumina/manta/blob/master/docs/userGuide/README.md

The configManta.py is located at:
/storage/homefs/kw23y068/software/Manta/build/src/python/bin/configManta.py

It needs a Python that is <3.0 AND > 2.6
Hence we use latest Python 2 on cluster:
module load Python/2.7.18-GCCcore-11.3.0-bare
